## Golem
Golem is a global, open-source, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can use. It is made up of the combined computing power of the users' machines, from PCs to entire data centers.To facilitate that exchange, Golem implements a decentralized marketplace where IT resources are rented out. The actors in this decentralized network can assume one of the two non-exclusive roles:  
**Requestor**  
Has a need to use IT resources such as computation hardware. Those resources are purchased in the decentralized market. The actual usage of the resources is backed by Golem's decentralized infrastructure.
**Provider**  
Has free IT resources that can be shared with other actors in the network. Those resources are sold in the decentralized market.
